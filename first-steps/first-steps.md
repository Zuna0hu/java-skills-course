# First Steps in Java Programming
This folder contains materials covering basic concepts in Java, including Hello World, variables, primitive types, type casting, operators, operands, expressions, and more.

## How to Use the Files
The folder includes JShell scripts. To use them, download the `.jsh` file and load it into JShell by running the following command:
```bash
jshell < myscript.jsh
```
This will execute the commands from the script file, allowing you to save and reuse the JShell commands.
