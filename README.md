## Why is JDK17 Used?
- **Stability**:  LTS versions minimize bugs and security issues, offering a more reliable platform for building applications, which is essential for companies requiring stable systems.
- **Extended Support**: Unlike regular releases, which are only supported for six months, LTS versions receive updates, security fixes, and patches for several years, ensuring a longer support window.
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Many libraries, tools, and frameworks focus their support on LTS versions, making it easier to find resources and maintain compatibility.
- **Maturity**: LTS versions are prioritized by companies because they allow for thorough testing and compatibility checks with existing systems before adopting new features found in regular releases.

## Setup
- **Operating System**: Linux(Xubuntu virtual machine)
- **Java Develop Kit(JDK)**: JDK 17
- **Integrated Development Environment(IDE)**: Intellij IDEA (community edition)

## Why Choose IntelliJ IDEA Over VS Code for Java Development

When it comes to Java development, the choice of Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can significantly impact your productivity and overall experience. While both IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) are popular among developers, many Java programmers prefer IntelliJ IDEA for various compelling reasons. Hereâ€™s why:

### 1. Comprehensive Feature Set
IntelliJ IDEA is specifically designed for Java development, offering a robust set of built-in tools and features. From smart code completion to advanced refactoring options, IntelliJ provides everything you need to develop Java applications efficiently.

### 2. Smart Code Completion
IntelliJ IDEA's intelligent code completion features offer context-aware suggestions based on the current code and project structure. This can save time and reduce errors, making coding faster and more intuitive compared to VS Code, which may require additional extensions for similar functionality.

### 3. Advanced Refactoring Tools
IntelliJ IDEA excels in its refactoring capabilities, allowing developers to safely and efficiently rename classes, methods, and variables, as well as restructure code. This level of refactoring support minimizes the risk of introducing bugs, enhancing code quality.

### 4. Built-in Tools and Integration
With built-in support for version control systems (like Git), build tools (such as Maven and Gradle), and testing frameworks (like JUnit), IntelliJ IDEA streamlines the development workflow. VS Code requires additional configuration and extensions to achieve similar integration.

### 5. Performance with Large Projects
IntelliJ IDEA is known for its efficient handling of large codebases. Its indexing and caching mechanisms provide a smooth experience even when navigating complex projects, which can be a challenge in VS Code.

### Conclusion
While VS Code is a versatile and powerful code editor, IntelliJ IDEA offers a more complete and tailored experience for Java development. Its robust feature set, intelligent tools, and seamless integration make it the preferred choice for many Java developers looking to enhance their productivity and code quality.
