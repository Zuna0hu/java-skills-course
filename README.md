# Why is JDK17 Used?
- **Stability**:  LTS versions minimize bugs and security issues, offering a more reliable platform for building applications, which is essential for companies requiring stable systems.
- **Extended Support**: Unlike regular releases, which are only supported for six months, LTS versions receive updates, security fixes, and patches for several years, ensuring a longer support window.
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Many libraries, tools, and frameworks focus their support on LTS versions, making it easier to find resources and maintain compatibility.
- **Maturity**: LTS versions are prioritized by companies because they allow for thorough testing and compatibility checks with existing systems before adopting new features found in regular releases.

# Setup
- **Operating System**: Linux(Xubuntu virtual machine)
